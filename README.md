# use-case-examples
SVG documents for messing around with. The primary purpose of these is to figure out the relevant use cases,
and how to meet them or what is lacking in SVG at the moment.

Please feel free to make pull requests on this readme (I don't do markdown very well) or on the files themselves.

there is a [simple shell script](buildHTML.sh) that makes an HTML version of the SVG

The key thing is to explain in your comments why your change makes the thing more accessible, and to whom.

We are tracking this through the [W3C SVG wiki](https://www.w3.org/wiki/SVG_Accessibility)
