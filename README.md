# use-case-examples
SVG documents for messing around with. The primary purpose of these is to figure out the relevant use cases, 
and how to meet them - or what is lacking in SVG at the moment to do so.

Please feel free to make pull requests on this readme (I don't do markdown very well) or on the files themselves.

The key thing is to explain in your comments why your change makes the thing more accessible, and to whom.

We are tracking this through the [W3C SVG wiki](https://www.w3.org/wiki/SVG_Accessibility)

So far a couple of images have been worked on:

;composed-tree
:[composed-tree.svg](composed-tree.svg) is a tree diagram, as per the [description](composed-tree-desc.html). There is also a version as [HTML with SVG code inline](composed-tree.html) and some [notes about the changes and lessons](composed-tree-notes.html).
:The original image came from the [W3C draft Shadow DOM specification](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow). Hopefully the improvements made here translate to an improvement in that document's accessibility.
;chem-BV-ox
:[chem-BV-ox.svg](chem-BV-ox.svg) presents a chemical reaction, using a graphical representation familiar to who work with organic chemistry. This is still very much a work in progress.
